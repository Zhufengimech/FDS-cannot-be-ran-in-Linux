# FDS-cannot-be-ran-in-Linux
Hello !!
I am trying to run FDS cases in the linux system. And I have compliled FDS following the FDS_User_Guide.
However, all the cases in the Example profile cannot be ran. For all the cases, it is giving the error:

/pub/home/zhufeng/FDS/FDS6/bin/fds: relocation error:/pub/home/zhufeng/FDS/FDS6/bin/fds: symbol kmp_aligned_malloc, version VERSION not 
defined in file libiomp5.so with link time reference

In both the windows and linux, i am using FDS 6.5.3.

Our system configuration is:
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.5 64-bit


Could you give me an idea of what is going wrong?
Thank you!
